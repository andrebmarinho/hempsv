#--------- Application definitions -----------
#Example of an application defining static mapping for two tasks
#- name: mpeg
#    start_time_ms: 0 #any unsigned integer number
#    static_mapping:
#      print: [1,1] # Task print from app mpeg will be mapped as static at address X=1, Y=1
#      start: [0,1] # Task start from app mpeg will be mapped as static at address X=1, Y=1
#
# Attention: When using static mapping all application must be manually sorted by start time
